The "Xacto" server implements a simple transactional object store, designed for use in a network environment. For the purposes of this assignment,
an object store is essentially a hash map that maps keys to values, where both keys and values can be arbitrary data. There are two basic operations
on the store: PUT and GET . As you might expect, the PUT operation associates a key with a value, and the GET operation retrieves the value
associated with a key. Although values may be null, keys may not. The null value is used as the default value associated with a key if no PUT has been
performed on that key.

A client wishing to make use of the object store first makes a network connection to the server. Upon connection, a transaction is created by the
server. All operations that the client performs during this session will execute in the scope of that transaction. The client issues a series of PUT and
GET requests to the server, receiving a response from each one. Upon completing the series of requests, the client issues a COMMIT request. If all is
well, the transaction commits and its effects on the store are made permanent. Due to interference of transactions being executed concurrently by
other clients, however, it is possible for a transaction to abort rather than committing. The effects of an aborted transaction are erased from the store
and it is as if the transaction had never happened. A transaction may abort at any time up until it has successfully committed; in particular the
response from any PUT or GET request might indicate that the transaction has aborted. When a transaction has aborted, the server closes the client
connection. The client may then open a new connection and retry the operations in the context of a new transaction.

The Xacto server architecture is that of a multi-threaded network server. When the server is started, a master thread sets up a socket on which to
listen for connections from clients. When a connection is accepted, a client service thread is started to handle requests sent by the client over that
connection. The client service thread executes a service loop in which it repeatedly receives a request packet sent by the client, performs the request,
and sends a reply packet that indicates the result. Besides request and reply packets, there are also data packets that are used to send key and value
data between the client and server.
